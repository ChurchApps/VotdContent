Verse of the Day Image Content



### Image Creator Instructions
- Select a verse to create images for from the /v1/verses.json file.
- Create a new folder for the day in the file (Day 27 = /v1/27/).
- Create 3 variants of the same image 16:9 (3840x2160) , 9:16 (2160x3840) and 1:1 (2000x2000)
- Upload the files in the folder you created as 16x9.jpg, 9x16.jpg and 1x1.jpg
- Also upload the source file (.ai, .psd, etc) to a /source folder under the folder you created (/v1/27/source/day27.ai)

*If the verse selection in the json file is not a good choice, you may choose another.  Search the file to make sure it's not already in use and then update the reference field in verses.json to state the new verse.*
